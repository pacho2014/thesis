\chapter{Requirements Analysis}
\label{chap:REQS}

The first step of this project was performing an overall requirements analysis
in order to determine the general needs of the \emph{Course2018} LMS.\ \ 
In this chapter, some key requirements will be investigated for their
feasibility and expectations.
Depending on the specifications of the requirements, they are categorized into
two categories: functional requirements and non-functional requirements.

\section{Terminologies}

\subsection{Functional requirement}
\label{sec:FUNC_REQS}
A functional requirement defines a task the system needs to accomplish,
as well as the behavior of the task, which is captured and described in detail
with use cases.
These requirements will be further analyzed to design the system components
model~\cite{functionalReqs}.

\subsection{Non-functional requirement}
As opposed to functional requirements, non-functional requirements describe
non-behavioral specifications such as system performance, security, and system
environments.

\subsection{Use cases}
A use case is a series of actions performed by one or more actors interacting
with the system to accomplished a task~\cite{useCase}.

\medskip 

Use cases in this thesis are composed of the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Primary actor}:
The main user (could be a person or an external system) who interacts with the
system.

\item \textbf{User story}:
A brief description of the task that the primary actor wishes to accomplish.

\item \textbf{Preconditions}:
Prerequisites to the test case,
conditions or states that must be satisfied prior to the start of the workflow.

\item \textbf{Postconditions}:
Conditions or states that must be satisfied after the workflow is finished.

\item \textbf{Triggers}:
An event (or a series of events) that starts the execution of the workflow.

\item \textbf{Basic flow}:
A step-by-step description of the detailed interactions between the actor and
the system, as well as the activities performed by the system.

\end{itemize}

\section{Functional requirements}
\label{FUNCREQS}

\subsection{User authentication}

The system must provide routines to handle activities related to user accounts
such as user login, permission checking for restricted content, and user logout.

\subsubsection{Use cases}

\begin{enumerate}
\item User login:
\begin{itemize}
\item Primary actor:
    a registered user of the \emph{Course2018} LMS.
\item User story:
    a user wishes to have access to some restricted content, therefore, the user 
    first needs to login to the system.
\item Precondition:
    the user is at the login interface, and the login credentials
    (namely, username and password) are input into the corresponding fields.
\item Postconditions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item On success: an interface with the user's information (such as courses
            in which this user is registered) will be presented to the user.
        \item On failure: a login interface with an error message will be
            presented to the user.
    \end{itemize}
\item Trigger: the \emph{Login} button is clicked.
\item Basic flow:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The user's login credentials are encrypted and sent to the
            server.
        \item The server compares the user's login credentials against the
            account database.
        \item If a match is found in the database, an interface with the user's
            information will be returned and the user will have access to
            some restricted content to which the user is authorized; otherwise,
            a login interface with error messages will be returned.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\item Permission checking:
\begin{itemize}
\item Primary actor: 
    a registered user of the \emph{Course2018} LMS
\item User story:
    the user request for accessing content for which the user may or may not
    have permission.
\need 1 in
\item Precondition:
        the user is logged into the system.
\item Postconditions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item On success: an interface with the requested content will be presented
            to the user.
        \item On failure: an interface indicates that the user is unauthorized will
            be presented to the user.
    \end{itemize}
\item Trigger: the user types the request URL to the browser location field
    or clicks on a link to the URL.
\item Basic flow:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The request (i.e., the desired URL) of the user is sent to the server.
        \item The server checks if the request is valid, namely, if the user
            is logged in and if the user has permission to access the requested
            content.
        \item If the request is valid, an interface with the requested content will
            be returned; otherwise, an interface with an error message 
            indicating the request is unauthorized will be returned.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Course information handling}

                URL to that file will be returned.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Assignment source code control}
The system shall provide abilities for students to keep track of their
assignment source code, that is, keeping a change log for each source code
file so that students can compare the changes every time they submit a new
version of an assignment file.

\subsubsection{Use cases}
\begin{enumerate}
\item View differences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary actor: a registered student.
    \item User story: the user wishes to see the changes between the two most recent
        submissions of the assignment.
    \item Preconditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The user is logged in to the system.
            \item The user has made at least two submissions on one source code
                file.
            \item The user is at the file display interface of the changed file,
                where there is a \emph{Diff} button on the interface.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Postcondition:
        an interface, with changes between the last two versions of that file
        displayed, is presented to the user.
    \item Trigger: the \emph{Diff} button is clicked.
    \item Basic flow:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A \emph{view diff} request with the file identifier is sent
                to the server.
            \item The server examines the request and makes sure the user has
                permission to view (the versions of) the requested file.
            \item If the request is valid, the server will have the current
                version of the source code compared with the previous version,
                then have the result of the comparison formatted and
                returned.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Automated code testing}
\label{sec:AUTOTEST}
For programming assignments, the system shall have some routines to build and
run the students' programs automatically with sample data provided by the
instructor, and have the test result available for the users shortly after an
assignment is submitted.

\subsubsection{Use cases}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Configure automated tests for an assignment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary actor: a registered instructor.
    \item User story: the user wishes to enable automated tests for an
        assignment.
    \item Preconditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The user is logged in to the system.
            \item The user has previously created a course.
            \item The user has previously created a programming assignment for
                that course.
            \item The user is at the summary interface of the assignment to
                enable and configure automated tests.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Postconditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An automated test scheme will be created.
            \item Any future submissions will be tested with this scheme.
            \item Each time a prior submission is viewed the user will be given
                the option to run the corresponding tests.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Triggers:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The user enables and configures (such as compile commands, 
                time limit, and
                test cases) the automated tests with a dynamic form (a form
                with fields that automatically change according to the previous
                input data) on the
                interface.
            \item The \emph{Save} button at the end of the form is clicked by
                the user.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Basic flow:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The form data is validated for errors
                (i.e., if there are required fields with no input,
                if there is non-numeric
                in numeric fields, or if there is input with length greater
                than the maximum text length allowance defined in the database)
                immediately on the client side of the system (because it is a
                dynamic form). Error messages
                will be displayed if the validation failed.
            \item If the validation is successful, the configuration data is
                serialized into a block of \emph{JSON} \cite{JSON} formatted text and
                encapsulated in a request which is then encrypted and sent to
                the server.
            \item The server examines the request and makes sure the user has
                permission to enable and configure an automated test.
            \item The server decodes the \emph{JSON} text and saves the data to
                the system database.
            \item The server creates a \emph{shell script}~\cite[Chapter 3]{shellScript}
                for the automated test using the configuration data from the
                system database.
            \item A success or failure message is returned to the user.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\item View automated test result:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary actor: a registered student.
    \item User story: the user wishes to view the automated test result of the
        assignment.
    \item Preconditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The user is logged in to the system.
            \item The user has submitted a programming assignment for which an
                automated test had been enabled prior to the submission.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Postcondition:
        an interface with the automated test result will be presented to the
        user.
    \item Trigger: the \emph{Test Result} button is clicked by the user.
    \item Basic flow:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A request for the test result is encrypted and sent to the
                server.
            \item The server examines the request and makes sure the user has
                permission to view the requested test result.
            \item The server fetches the test result and performs syntax
                highlighting upon the result.
            \item An interface with the test result is returned.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assignment marking}
The system shall provide tools for instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) to
grade the students' assignment.

In this thesis, the term \emph{Markers} refers to a group of users who have
permission to grade the assignments (i.e., the instructor and TAs of a course).

\subsubsection{Use cases}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Grade assignments:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary actor: a registered user.
    \item User story: the user wishes to grade an assignment.
    \item Preconditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The user is logged in to the system.
            \item The user is a marker in the course
                to which the assignment belongs.
            \item The user is at the marker interface where there
                is a table displaying all the submitted assignments.
        \end{itemize}
    \need 1 in
    \item Postcondition:
            the grade and feedback from the user will be saved and be
            available for the student who submitted the assignment as soon
            as the instructor releases the grades.
    \item Trigger:
        the user clicked the \emph{Mark} button on one of the submitted
        assignments.
    \item Basic flow:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A \emph{mark assignment} request is sent to the server.
            \item The server examines the request and makes sure the user has
                marker permission for this assignment
                (see Section~\ref{sec:ASNMAN}).
            \item If the request is valid, a marking interface is returned to
                the user; otherwise, a page with an \emph{unauthorized} error
                message is returned to the user.
            \item A marking interface composed of two sections
                (a file(s) display section and a comments section)
                is presented to the user.
            \item The user checks the files and enters comments and the
                grade for this assignment.
            \item The user selects the \emph{Save} button.
            \item The comments and grade are encapsulated in a request which
                is then encrypted and sent to the server.
            \item The server saves the grade and the feedback to the system
                database.
            \item A success or failure message is returned to the user.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
