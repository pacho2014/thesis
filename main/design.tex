\chapter{System Design}
\label{chap:SYSDES}

With all the key requirements being laid out in the previous chapter, it is
time to analyze them and have a system design model in an abstract
level drawn. 

\section{Specifications}
Non-functional requirements will be investigated first to decide the
non-behavioral specifications of the system, specifications like the
programming language and framework that powers the system, choice of database,
and environment in which the system will be running.

\subsection{Framework}
Debate on whether or not it is better to use a framework is never failed to be
a popular topic in the developer communities. On one hand, many developers
believe that a framework puts a lot of constrains to a project which limits the
overall control to the it (especially core behaviors) \cite{frameworks};
on the other hand, a framework offers a better degree of efficiency and better
measurements of security to a project, while keeping the simplicity and
the architectural clarity of the project by enforcing the developers to apply
an architectural pattern (such as the \emph{model-view-controller} pattern
\cite{mvc}) to their projects.

\medskip

Given the development time frame, requirements for
security and maintainability (see 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.3),
as well as the scale of the this project,
it is not unjustifiable for this project to use a web framework to achieve a
better result.

\medskip

The framework this project uses is called \emph{Django}, an open-source web
framework written in \emph{Python}. \emph{Django} was originally developed by
the web programming team at the \emph{Lawrence Journal-World} newspaper in 2003,
dedicated for the the company to deliver their contents as fast as possible
(James Bennett, 2008 \cite{django}). With more than a decade of improvements
being made to the framework, it is now among one of the most popular web
frameworks in the world, used by large companies like the
\emph{Washington Post} (Adrian Holovaty, 2005 \cite{djangoWashingtonPost})
and \emph{Instagram} (Instagram Engineering, 2011 \cite{djangoInstagram}).
\medskip

The framework provides a set of libraries to handle most basic aspects of web
application development. One good example of those libraries is the
\emph{object-relational mapper}, the framework has the ability to create
relational database schemas based on the \emph{Python} classes written by the
programmer, so that no hand-written SQL query is required
(James Bennett, 2008 \cite{django}) for most of the
database operations (such as select, filter, remove, and insert database
records)
, making the possibility of having \emph{SQL Injection} vulnerabilities next
to zero.
